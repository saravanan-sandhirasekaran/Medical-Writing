1. Clinical Development Plan (CDP)
Purpose: High-level roadmap of the clinical strategy for a drug or device across all phases.

Contains: Strategic objectives, targeted indications, primary/secondary endpoints for each study.

Format: Usually .docx or .pdf

Usage: Main reference for aligning study objectives with program goals.

2. Target Product Profile (TPP)
Purpose: Regulatory-facing summary of the intended use, efficacy, safety, and key clinical outcomes.

Contains: Desired label claims, key endpoints required to support claims.

Format: .docx, .xlsx, or .pdf

Usage: Helps define endpoints that will support regulatory approval and labeling.

3. Investigatorâ€™s Brochure (IB)
Purpose: Summary of preclinical and clinical data for investigators.

Contains: Rationale for the study, prior efficacy/safety findings.

Format: .docx or .pdf

Usage: Supports justification of the primary and secondary objectives and risk profile.

4. Previous Clinical Study Reports (CSRs)
Purpose: Reports from earlier phases (e.g., Phase 1 or 2 studies).

Contains: Outcomes and endpoints from prior studies, informing what to pursue or refine.

Format: .docx or .pdf

Usage: Provides evidence to design next-phase endpoints and expected results.

5. Regulatory Guidance Documents
Purpose: Define acceptable endpoints and outcome measures per indication.

Source: FDA, EMA, ICH (e.g., FDA Guidance for Diabetes, Oncology, etc.)

Format: .pdf

Usage: Ensures endpoints are aligned with regulatory expectations.

6. Scientific Literature & Competitor Protocols
Purpose: Benchmarking and supporting clinical justification.

Format: .pdf, publications, or trial registry data (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov)
